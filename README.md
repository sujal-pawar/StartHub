## üìö What I Learned

### Next.js 14 and Partial Prerendering (PPR)

Implementing Next.js 14's Partial Prerendering (PPR) was a game-changer for this project. PPR provides the best of both static and dynamic rendering by:

- Streaming initial static HTML shell for immediate display
- Dynamically loading interactive components and data
- Using the `experimental_ppr` flag to optimize specific routes
- Leveraging Suspense boundaries for component-level streaming

I implemented PPR in the startup detail pages and user profiles, resulting in significantly improved LCP metrics while maintaining dynamic content capabilities.

```tsx
// Example of PPR implementation in startup detail page
export const experimental_ppr = true;

const Page = async ({ params }) => {
  // ...
  return (
    <>
      <StaticShellComponent />
      <Suspense fallback={<Skeleton />}>
        <DynamicContentComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Serial vs. Parallel Data Fetching

Understanding when to use serial vs. parallel data fetching patterns was crucial for optimizing performance:

- **Parallel Data Fetching**: For independent data requests, used Promise.all to fetch data concurrently
- **Serial Data Fetching**: For dependent data sequences where one request depends on another
- **Intelligent Waterfalls**: Created optimized data loading patterns to minimize blocking

```tsx
// Parallel data fetching example
const [startupData, userData] = await Promise.all([
  fetchStartupData(id),
  fetchUserData(authorId)
]);

// Serial data fetching example (when necessary)
const startup = await fetchStartupData(id);
const relatedStartups = await fetchRelatedStartups(startup.category);
```

### SEO Optimization & Metadata

Next.js 14's metadata API provided powerful tools for SEO optimization:

- Created dynamic metadata for every page using both static and generated metadata
- Implemented OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata for social sharing
- Generated dynamic OG images based on content
- Created a reusable metadata generation utility
- Implemented sitemap.xml, robots.txt, and manifest.json
- Used structured data for search engine optimization

```tsx
// Dynamic metadata generation for startup pages
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const startup = await fetchStartupData(params.id);
  
  return {
    title: startup.title,
    description: startup.description,
    openGraph: {
      images: [startup.image],
      // ...other OG properties
    }
  };
}
```

### Sanity.io CMS Integration

Working with Sanity.io provided insights into headless CMS architecture:

- Structured content modeling with schemas for startups and authors
- Real-time content updates with GROQ queries
- Content validation and relationships between documents
- Optimistic UI updates with live queries
- Error handling and fallback strategies for API timeouts
- Image handling and transformations

```typescript
// Example GROQ query with relationships
export const STARTUP_BY_ID_QUERY = defineQuery(
  `*[_type == "startup" && _id==$id][0]{
    _id, title, slug, _createdAt,
    author->{ _id, name, username, image, bio },
    views, description, image, category, pitch
  }`
);
```

### Sentry for Monitoring Production Apps

Implementing Sentry provided important lessons in monitoring large-scale applications:

- Error tracking and performance monitoring with Sentry's Next.js SDK
- Custom error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Transaction tracking for critical user flows
- Sourcemap uploads for accurate error stack traces
- Environment-specific configurations for dev/prod environments
- API route monitoring and backend error tracking

```tsx
// Setting up Sentry for client, server, and Edge runtimes
Sentry.init({
  dsn: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN,
  tracesSampleRate: 1.0, 
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,
  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,
  // Environment-specific settings
});
```

### Authentication Flow & Middleware

Building a robust authentication system with NextAuth.js and middleware:

- GitHub OAuth integration with secure callback handling
- Session management and token refresh strategies
- Route protection with Next.js middleware
- Conditional rendering based on authentication state
- Custom login page with branded design
- Error handling for authentication failures

```tsx
// Middleware for protecting routes and redirecting unauthenticated users
export default withAuthMiddleware((req) => {
  const { pathname } = req.nextUrl;
  const isAuth = req.auth;
  
  // Redirect logic based on auth state and paths
  if (!isAuth && !publicPaths.includes(pathname)) {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/login', req.url));
  }
});
```

### Responsive UI & Accessibility

Developing a modern, accessible UI brought valuable lessons:

- Component-based design with shadcn/ui for consistency
- Responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
- Dark/light mode implementation with theme persistence
- Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- Focus management for improved accessibility
- Animation performance optimization

### Error Handling & Fallbacks

Creating a resilient application required comprehensive error handling:

- Graceful degradation with error boundaries
- Loading states and fallback UI components
- API error handling with retry mechanisms
- Network error detection and offline support
- User feedback for error states
